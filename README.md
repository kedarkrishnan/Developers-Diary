# Developers-Diary
A diary of a software developer as he sails through the vast sea of knowledge of ever changing technologies. Passionate to learn he writes his learnings down to discover more and more.

As a self taught developer who learned a lot from the all mighty internet this is a tiny little way of giving back to the internet world.


###Bare Bones
The bare minimum required by a developer to start on a tool or language. The intent of the bare bone series is to give novice developers a starting point to starting learning.
